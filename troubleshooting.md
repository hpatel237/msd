i committed a change in feature branch as well as a different change in the main branch on the same file. 
I tried to merge the branch onto the main branch however there was a conflict. 
I resolved the conflict by keeping what was on the main branch and deleting the changes on the feature branch. Then i merged both and the conflict was resolved.
